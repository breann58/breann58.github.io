        </div>

						<div class="col-md-11 text-justify">
						<p>Doula: <i>noun</i>. Greek for &lsquo;woman who serves.&rsquo; This simple word has been chosen to identify the women who champion a positive birth experience. A Doula, at a basic level, is simply a person (typically female) who attends a birth. But beyond that, a Doula is:
            <br><br>
            An advocate: she will help you find your voice and ensure your birth preferences are heard and honored; 
            <br><br>An educator: from prenatal visits to hurried conversations between contractions, she will answer your questions and provide you with information so you can always make an informed decision; 

            <br><br>A witness: she will be present for the entirety of your birth, and honor the transformation from woman to mother, timid to powerful, fear to joy; 
            <br><br>A beacon of positivity: when you look at her and say &lsquo;I can’t do this&rsquo; she will smile and say &lsquo;you <u>are</u> doing it!&rsquo;

            <p>The right to choose your own birthing experience is in my blood&mdash;having been born at home myself at a time when lay midwifery was not legally recognized. But it lay dormant for some time. 
            <br><br>

            I graduated from Colorado College with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Psychology and Dance. After which I worked with children with Autism and children overcoming past abuse. I took a pause from childcare to spend several years working as a project manager at a tech startup. And then, by happenstance, I was invited to attend a family member&apos;s birth. 
            <br><br>

            72 hours later, after timing contractions, cooking meals, fetching towels, squeezing hips, taking photos, I witnessed the wonders of natural birth. For weeks after I found myself daydreaming about the experience, pulling up the photos to look through them one more time, telling anyone who would listen how absolutely incredible the event was (I may have even used the term &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo;).
            <br><br>

            Suddenly, all of the pieces fell into place. I clearly saw how my life choices leading up to this moment had prepared me to be the person women would look to as their birth advocate, educator and witness. </p>
